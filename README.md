# Wireframing

## Introduction  
Wireframing is a crucial step in the design process that helps visualize the structure and functionality of a digital product before moving into detailed design and development. It serves as a **blueprint** for websites, mobile applications, or software systems, outlining how content and elements will be arranged on each screen.

## Importance of Wireframing  
- **Clarity of Ideas:** Wireframes help communicate design concepts clearly to stakeholders, developers, and designers.  
- **Focus on Functionality:** They emphasize layout, structure, and user interaction without being distracted by colors, typography, or detailed graphics.  
- **Early Feedback:** Wireframes provide an opportunity to gather feedback early in the process and make necessary changes before investing time in high-fidelity designs.  
- **Efficient Development:** By clearly mapping out user flows and layouts, wireframes reduce misunderstandings and save time during implementation.
